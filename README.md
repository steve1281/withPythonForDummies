====================

Studying : Beginning Programming with Python for Dummies

General notes and programming - I am not checking the source from the book here.

This is now complete; I am done with this book.  I may remove this at anytime.

Overall, the book is very elementry; but thats pretty much what you would expect.

Start with scratch_pad.py  - I keep most of the stuff you type at the console in there.

Thanks for your time,
